I’m not just analyzing data—I’m building the next wave of smart, actionable solutions. My passion is using technology to improve daily life, empower teams, and create value where others see only process.

### 🌟 What Sets Me Apart?

* **Entrepreneurial Vision:** I thrive at the intersection of tech and business. My journey (from launching OnSpot, a smart parking optimization platform, to developing predictive analytics pipelines) proves I don’t just theorize—I execute and deliver results.
* **Tech-Powered Problem Solver:** Whether wrangling data with Python and SQL, designing seamless web experiences in Framer, or automating business intelligence workflows, I make complex systems simple and impactful.
* **Business Translator:** I excel in bridging gaps between what’s possible technically and what’s valuable strategically, translating data insights into business growth and product innovation.
* **Leadership With Empathy:** Teams succeed when you can communicate, collaborate, and drive outcomes. I bring structure, clarity, and motivation—turning project plans into success stories.
* **Relentless Learner:** I don’t settle—always leveling up with new tools (like Power BI, advanced ML modeling, or web app frameworks) to keep ahead of what the future demands.

### 📈 Recent Impact

* **OnSpot:** Built and launched a smart-city parking app from concept to demo, integrating machine learning, urban IoT, and web technologies to solve real user problems.
* **Data Strategy & Analysis:** Led the design and implementation of full-cycle predictive modeling pipelines for academic and business datasets—driving measurable process efficiency.
